          <h2>Coorg Cuisine</h2>
          <h3 class="curve-text text-blue">Bliss on a plate</h3>
          <p>
            Kodava culture and history have both greatly influenced their food
            habits. Food is an integral part of the Kodava culture and it is not
            taken lightly. The daily meal of a Kodava family is simple fare. The
            people of Coorg have been agriculturists from time immemorial. Their
            main occupation was paddy cultivation for a long time before coffee,
            spices and fruits were introduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            So rice forms a major part of Coorg cuisine. They loved hunting game
            for sport and food and foraged for wild produce. Long before
            foraging became a cool thing to do, the Kodavas went foraging for
            bamboo, wild mushrooms, green leafy vegetables and fruits. Coorg
            cuisine is made up of seasonal produce and meat that is flavoured
            judiciously with spices but still retains its natural flavours.

          <p>
            Noolputtu (string hoppers) are fine rice noodles made from a steamed
            dough of fine-grained broken rice and water. The dough is passed
            through a special noolputtu vara. A small plate is held underneath
            the press to catch the noodles. The plate is slowly turned around to
            ensure that the noodles have a nice circular shape.

            The steamed rice dumpling called kadambuttu is one of the most
            famous dishes in Coorg cuisine. They are tiny white balls of buttery
            deliciousness that melt in your mouth. It is made with broken rice
            called kadumbuttu thari. The thari is cooked in boiling water with a
            small dollop of ghee, till it becomes a thick dough.
          </p>

          <p>
            The cooked dough is kneaded till it’s smooth and rolled into small

          <p>
            Kachampuli is the concentrated extract of a fruit called
            panapuli.This extract gives the pandi curry its dark colour and its
            signature sour taste. The rich, dark, spicy curry is worthy of all
            the attention it gets as one of the most famous foods in Coorg.

          <p>Pandi curry goes very well with kadambuttu and akki otti.</p>

          <h2>Coorg Cuisine</h2>
          <h3 class="curve-text text-blue">Bliss on a plate</h3>
          <p>
            Kodava culture and history have both greatly influenced their food
            habits. Food is an integral part of the Kodava culture and it is not
            taken lightly. The daily meal of a Kodava family is simple fare. The
            people of Coorg have been agriculturists from time immemorial. Their
            main occupation was paddy cultivation for a long time before coffee,
            spices and fruits were introduced.
          </p>
          <p>
            So rice forms a major part of Coorg cuisine. They loved hunting game
            for sport and food and foraged for wild produce. Long before
            foraging became a cool thing to do, the Kodavas went foraging for
            bamboo, wild mushrooms, green leafy vegetables and fruits. Coorg
            cuisine is made up of seasonal produce and meat that is flavoured
            judiciously with spices but still retains its natural flavours.

            Noolputtu (string hoppers) are fine rice noodles made from a steamed
            dough of fine-grained broken rice and water. The dough is passed
            through a special noolputtu vara. A small plate is held underneath
            the press to catch the noodles. The plate is slowly turned around to
            ensure that the noodles have a nice circular shape.

            panapuli.This extract gives the pandi curry its dark colour and its

            Coorg is one of those places in India where the climate remains
            pleasant all through the year. Each season has its own charm and
            will give you a special reason to visit. Be it summer, winter or
            monsoon, Coorg always welcomes its visitors and enthrals them with
            its spectacular beauty.
          </li>

          <li>
            March to May (Summer): There is a pleasant wind blowing that helps
            you lay back relax and enjoy the clear sight of the hills. You can
            plan all your activities to the various places of interest like the
            Golden Temple, the beautiful Madikeri Fort flaunting its beautiful
            17th-century architecture, the vast floral and faunal diversity that
            Nagarhole National Park promises, the Abbey Falls or the majestic
